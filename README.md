# mcp-lifecycle-operator

A Kubernetes operator that provides a declarative API to deploy, manage, and safely roll out MCP Servers, handling their full lifecycle with production-grade automation and ecosystem integrations.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.28+)
- kubectl configured to access your cluster
- Go 1.24+ (for building from source)

## Testing on Your Cluster

### 1. Install the CRDs

First, install the Custom Resource Definitions:

```bash
make install
```

This creates the `MCPServer` CRD in your cluster.

### 2. Run the Controller

You have two options:

#### Option A: Run Locally (Recommended for Testing)

Run the controller on your local machine (it will connect to your cluster):

```bash
make run
```

Keep this terminal open. The controller logs will appear here.

#### Option B: Deploy to Cluster

Build and deploy the controller as a Deployment in your cluster:

```bash
# Build and push the container image for multiple platforms
make docker-buildx IMG=<your-registry>/mcp-lifecycle-operator:latest

# Deploy to cluster
make deploy IMG=<your-registry>/mcp-lifecycle-operator:latest
```

Note: `docker-buildx` builds for multiple architectures (amd64, arm64, s390x, ppc64le) and pushes automatically.

### 3. Create a Test MCPServer

In a new terminal, create a test `MCPServer` resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: mcp.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: test-server
  namespace: default
spec:
  image: aliok/mcp-server-streamable-http:latest
  port: 8081
EOF
```

### 4. Verify the Deployment

Check that the operator created the resources:

```bash
# View the MCPServer status
kubectl get mcpservers
kubectl get mcpserver test-server -o yaml

# Verify the Deployment was created
kubectl get deployment test-server

# Verify the Service was created
kubectl get service test-server

# Check the pod is running
kubectl get pods -l mcp-server=test-server
```

Expected output from `kubectl get mcpservers`:
```
NAME          PHASE     IMAGE                                      PORT   AGE
test-server   Running   aliok/mcp-server-streamable-http:latest   8081   1m
```

### 5. Test the Service

Port-forward to test connectivity:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/test-server 8081:8081
```

Then in another terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/mcp
```

You should see a response from the MCP server.

### 6. Uninstall (Optional)

To remove the CRDs and operator:

```bash
# If you deployed to cluster
make undeploy

# Remove the CRDs
make uninstall
```

## Example MCPServer Resources

### Streamable HTTP MCP Server

```yaml
apiVersion: mcp.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: streamable-http-server
  namespace: default
spec:
  image: aliok/mcp-server-streamable-http:latest
  port: 8081
```

### Custom MCP Server

```yaml
apiVersion: mcp.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: custom-server
  namespace: default
spec:
  image: my-registry.io/custom-mcp-server:1.0.0
  port: 8000
```

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Generate code and manifests
make manifests generate

# Build binary
make build

# Run tests
make test
```
